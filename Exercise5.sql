/* what are Foreign Key?
Foreign key is a field in one table that links to the primary key of another table. It creates relationship between two tables.

/* delete cascade 
A delete cascade means that when a record in the parent table
(the table with the primary key ) is deleted all corresponding records
in the child table (the table with the foreign key) will also be deleted
automatically. */

/* update cascade
An update cascade means that when the primary ke of a record in the 
parent table is updated, all corresponding foreign keys in the
child table will also be updated automatically. */
